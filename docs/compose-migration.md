# Compose UI architecture and migration

The target is a Compose UI for all application screens, with no generated ViewBinding
or XML page/preference layouts. AndroidManifest.xml, strings, colors, drawable resources,
backup rules, and app-widget metadata are Android resources and remain valid in a Compose app.

## Package structure

Keep features together under `io.legado.app.ui`, with shared UI in explicit packages:

These are project conventions, not a package hierarchy mandated by Compose. Keep
existing `data`, `model`, and `help` functionality stable while migrating consumers.
Extract reusable data operations into repositories when feature boundaries justify
it. Do not create a domain layer or a Gradle module solely to wrap one existing call.

## Implementation rules

- Screens receive immutable values and event lambdas. They do not load preferences,
  access databases, start services, or obtain Activity/ViewModel instances.
- Routes connect screen state and Android effects. Collect StateFlow with
  `collectAsStateWithLifecycle`. Existing LiveData may be adapted during migration.
- ViewModels own changing screen state and screen operations; expose read-only flows.
  Store small restorable keys with SavedStateHandle, not Activity instances or bitmap data.
- Static screens can use simple screen state without a ViewModel.
- Use Material Surface to provide the theme background and content color;
  MaterialTheme alone does not set the text foreground for arbitrary containers.
- Keep UI state flowing down and events flowing up. Represent selection by stable
  destination identity, so configurable tab visibility cannot change what is selected.
- Keep file decoding, database queries and network requests off the main thread.
  Start composition-related effects with keyed effects rather than executing them in
  a composable body. Use viewModelScope for screen operations that survive recreation.
- Accept a root Modifier on reusable UI. Give interactive elements labels and roles;
  key lazy-list items by stable identity. Reuse the existing theme and translations.
- Use AndroidView only at documented platform/special-control boundaries, with correct
  lifecycle cleanup. Wrapping an XML page or RecyclerView is not a completed migration.
- Test screen behavior, restoration, filtering and operation cancellation, not just
  whether a composable exists.

## Current boundary

The main shell, welcome screen, automatic-task debug screen, and My/More screen
content no longer have XML layouts or ViewBinding. My/More also removes its Preference
XML and uses a preferences repository to retain existing backup-compatible keys.
The customization draft is saved separately from committed settings; Cancel does
not persist it or change services. Service observers run only while the destination
is resumed, and runtime status synchronization does not restart services. The existing About screen now shares theme, top bar and
settings components. The Compose host no longer inherits the ViewBinding host.

Crash-log listing and clearing now use Compose with a repository and StateFlow.
Local logs retain precedence over backup logs with the same filename. Clearing
refreshes the list even after partial failure; cancelled reads cannot open deleted
logs. Pending text-viewer navigation is acknowledged only after the resumed host
can show it. The shared TextDialog used to read log contents remains a legacy
consumer and will be migrated separately.

Application logs now expose immutable StateFlow snapshots with stable entry IDs;
existing Triple-based consumers and event notifications remain compatible. The
application-log dialog uses Compose for its list, clear confirmation and export
menu, and collects live updates only while resumed. Both application and HTTP
records are cleared after confirmation. Small exports retain text sharing; exports
over 64,000 characters use independent cache files written off the main thread.
Detail and share requests remain pending until a resumed host handles them. Text
selection and web links use Compose APIs. App-log details still use shared TextDialog.

WaitDialog now renders Compose progress and text without a layout or ViewBinding.
Its existing show/dismiss/setText API remains valid. Reusing the same dialog installs
a fresh Compose host for the new ComponentDialog lifecycle.

Cover-rule editing now uses Compose. Draft fields survive recreation independently
of persisted configuration. Cancellation and late loading results cannot overwrite
a draft or write after closing. Save/delete failures preserve the open draft; Cancel
does not persist it.

External-link confirmation and its transparent Activity now use Compose without
ViewBinding. The public URI, MIME and source arguments remain compatible. Source
mutations do not retain a Fragment callback. Recreation keeps one dialog and does
not finish the host; normal dismissal still finishes it.

Image verification and its transparent Activity now use Compose without XML UI or
ViewBinding. Input, confirmation and completion state survive recreation; request
results remain isolated by verificationResultKey. Configuration changes do not
cancel the request or finish the host. Glide waits and preview-file writes run on
IO with cancellation cleanup. Each enlarged preview uses an independent cache
file, so reloading cannot recycle a bitmap held by a restored PhotoDialog. The shared
PhotoDialog remains a legacy consumer and will be migrated separately.

Manga e-ink threshold settings now use Compose with a preferences boundary,
immutable StateFlow, lifecycle-aware reader previews and SavedStateHandle drafts.
Closing without an edit preserves the stored threshold rather than writing the
old default of 150. Rotation does not persist the draft; delayed reads cannot
overwrite edits or write after dismissal. The dedicated XML layout is removed.

Manga color-filter settings now use Compose for brightness and RGBA controls,
retaining the 0–255 range, slider and single-step adjustments and adding numeric
input. Drafts survive recreation without early persistence. Reader callbacks
receive independent mutable copies of immutable UI state; late reads and repeat
dismissals cannot replace or resave a finished draft. The XML layout is removed.

Manga footer settings now use Compose for all seven hide options, footer
visibility and alignment. SavedStateHandle retains an immutable draft, preserving
legacy JSON fields and defaults. Reader events receive independent configuration
copies. Each RESUMED entry reapplies the current draft because the reader itself
reloads committed settings during recreation. Only real dismissal persists;
subsequent edits, preview requests and duplicate dismissal callbacks are ignored.
The dedicated XML layout is removed.

Video settings and the long-press speed picker now use Compose. Boolean settings
retain immediate writes to existing preference keys. The speed picker retains
0.5–6.0 in 0.1 increments, explicit confirmation/cancellation and a 3.0 default;
its uncommitted draft survives recreation. Fullscreen-on-start visibility follows
autoplay from the first composition. The DialogFragment has a no-argument
constructor and no retained Context. Its dedicated XML layout is removed.

Automatic reading controls now use Compose with the existing bottom-bar colors,
window behavior, catalog/menu/stop/page-animation actions and 1–120 second speed
range. Dragging updates a restorable draft; finishing persists and schedules TTS
rate updates only for a resumed host. A View-scoped, idempotent count lease avoids
double decrements, rejected-dialog decrements and stale host references across
recreation. Its dedicated XML layout is removed.

Highlight shadow and underline tuning now use Compose with saveable drafts and
shared half-step parameter controls. Radius, signed offsets, width and distance
retain their existing limits, formatting and 0.5 increments. Confirmation preserves
color and underline kind and delivers the parent callback once; cancellation does
not apply edits. Both dedicated XML layouts are removed.

The main shell still hosts bookshelf, discovery and RSS View fragments and the
Compose-content My fragment inside `LegacyMainPager`. The majority of the app is still unmigrated. Remaining
work includes these destinations, settings/preferences, search and book details,
source editors/import dialogs, RSS screens, file management, reading/audio/manga/PDF
controls, and all other dialogs. Completion must not be inferred from enabling
`buildFeatures.compose` or adding an AndroidView wrapper.

Replace destination internals with feature Routes before removing the pager. Once all
navigation destinations are composables, migrate navigation to a Compose navigation
host, remove obsolete Activity/Fragment entry points as appropriate, then remove
ViewBinding, legacy adapters and unreferenced page/preference XML. Preserve public
intent/deep-link contracts through the app entry point.

## Validation

```sh
./gradlew :app:compileAppDebugKotlin
./gradlew :app:testAppDebugUnitTest \
  --tests 'io.legado.app.ui.main.MainUiStateTest' \
  --tests 'io.legado.app.ui.autoTask.AutoTaskDebugOutputTest'
./gradlew :app:compileAppDebugAndroidTestKotlin
./gradlew :app:connectedAppDebugAndroidTest \
  -Pandroid.testInstrumentationRunnerArguments.class=io.legado.app.ui.main.MainScreenTest
```

UI tests require a device/emulator. Also exercise launch delay zero/nonzero,
custom welcome backgrounds, night theme, e-ink mode, keyboard insets, bottom-bar skin
fallbacks, tab hiding, swipes, reselection, process recreation, and debug reruns on a device.
Compilation or JVM tests alone do not establish those runtime results.
