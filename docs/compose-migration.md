# Compose UI architecture and migration

The target is a Compose UI for all application screens, with no generated ViewBinding
or XML page/preference layouts. AndroidManifest.xml, strings, colors, drawable resources,
backup rules, and app-widget metadata are Android resources and remain valid in a Compose app.

## Package structure

Keep features together under `io.legado.app.ui`, with shared UI in explicit packages:

```text
base/
  BaseThemedActivity.kt         locale, window, background and platform behavior
  BaseComposeActivity.kt        Activity.setContent + app theme; no ViewBinding
  BaseActivity.kt               legacy View host, removed at end of migration
ui/
  theme/LegadoComposeTheme.kt   app colors and Material 3 theme
  components/                  shared stateless composables
    LegadoTopAppBar.kt
    SettingsItem.kt
  navigation/MainDestination.kt  stable destination identities
  main/
    MainActivity.kt            Android platform callbacks and navigation effects
    MainRoute.kt               lifecycle-aware state collection and resource loading
    MainScreen.kt              state + event callbacks + content slot
    MainUiState.kt
    MainViewModel.kt            main state and existing application operations
    interop/LegacyMainPager.kt  temporary adapter for unmigrated destinations
  welcome/
    WelcomeActivity.kt         startup/window/navigation effects
    WelcomeScreen.kt           static screen state and rendering
  autoTask/
    AutoTaskDebugActivity.kt    thin Android entry point
    AutoTaskDebugRoute.kt
    AutoTaskDebugScreen.kt
    AutoTaskDebugViewModel.kt
  about/
    AboutActivity.kt           Android effects and existing application operations
    AboutScreen.kt             stateless screen using common settings components
```

These are project conventions, not a package hierarchy mandated by Compose. Keep
existing `data`, `model`, and `help` functionality stable while migrating consumers.
Extract reusable data operations into repositories when feature boundaries justify
it. Do not create a domain layer or a Gradle module solely to wrap one existing call.

## Implementation rules

- Screens receive immutable values and event lambdas. They do not load preferences,
  access databases, start services, or obtain Activity/ViewModel instances.
- Routes connect screen state and Android effects. Collect StateFlow with
  `collectAsStateWithLifecycle`. Existing LiveData may be adapted during migration.
- ViewModels own changing screen state and screen operations; expose read-only flows.
  Store small restorable keys with SavedStateHandle, not Activity instances or bitmap data.
- Static screens can use simple screen state without a ViewModel.
- Keep UI state flowing down and events flowing up. Represent selection by stable
  destination identity, so configurable tab visibility cannot change what is selected.
- Keep file decoding, database queries and network requests off the main thread.
  Start composition-related effects with keyed effects rather than executing them in
  a composable body. Use viewModelScope for screen operations that survive recreation.
- Accept a root Modifier on reusable UI. Give interactive elements labels and roles;
  key lazy-list items by stable identity. Reuse the existing theme and translations.
- Use AndroidView only at documented platform/special-control boundaries, with correct
  lifecycle cleanup. Wrapping an XML page or RecyclerView is not a completed migration.
- Test screen behavior, restoration, filtering and operation cancellation, not just
  whether a composable exists.

## Current boundary

The main shell, welcome screen, and automatic-task debug screen no longer have XML
layouts or ViewBinding. The existing About screen now shares theme, top bar and
settings components. The Compose host no longer inherits the ViewBinding host.

The main shell still hosts the existing bookshelf, discovery, RSS and My fragments
inside `LegacyMainPager`. The majority of the app is still unmigrated. Remaining
work includes these destinations, settings/preferences, search and book details,
source editors/import dialogs, RSS screens, file management, reading/audio/manga/PDF
controls, and all other dialogs. Completion must not be inferred from enabling
`buildFeatures.compose` or adding an AndroidView wrapper.

Replace destination internals with feature Routes before removing the pager. Once all
navigation destinations are composables, migrate navigation to a Compose navigation
host, remove obsolete Activity/Fragment entry points as appropriate, then remove
ViewBinding, legacy adapters and unreferenced page/preference XML. Preserve public
intent/deep-link contracts through the app entry point.

## Validation

```sh
./gradlew :app:compileAppDebugKotlin
./gradlew :app:testAppDebugUnitTest \
  --tests 'io.legado.app.ui.main.MainUiStateTest' \
  --tests 'io.legado.app.ui.autoTask.AutoTaskDebugOutputTest'
./gradlew :app:compileAppDebugAndroidTestKotlin
./gradlew :app:connectedAppDebugAndroidTest \
  -Pandroid.testInstrumentationRunnerArguments.class=io.legado.app.ui.main.MainScreenTest
```

UI tests require a device/emulator. Also exercise launch delay zero/nonzero,
custom welcome backgrounds, night theme, e-ink mode, keyboard insets, bottom-bar skin
fallbacks, tab hiding, swipes, reselection, process recreation, and debug reruns on a device.
Compilation or JVM tests alone do not establish those runtime results.
